# EasyMouse

This is a project that aims to turn your phone into a usable mouse, allowing you to have an easy mouse anywhere. 
This project uses both accelerometer data and gyroscope data to give the position of the phone, and then a variety of handlers to take the data and transfer it to the computer via Bluetooth.
The purpose of this app is to replace the trackpad that exists on every laptop.
